of the base-level map areas. Currently, only the ground level works for tracking.

This module requires the `runescape_server_integration` module.

INSTALLATION
------------
Follow the standard installation of any Drupal module.

CONFIGURATION

This module provides a block plugin (map_tracking) that can be placed via block ui,
layout builder, or any other methods for placing blocks.
